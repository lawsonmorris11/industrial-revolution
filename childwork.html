        <center><p>Perhaps one of the worst features of this new industrial age was the use of child labour.
            <br>
            Very young children worked extremely long hours and could be severely punished for any mistakes. 
            <br>
            Arriving late for work could lead to a large fine and possibly a beating.</p></center>
