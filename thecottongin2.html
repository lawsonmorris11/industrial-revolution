        <h3>How much did it cost to make the spinning jenny?</h3>
        <p>Perhaps sometimes, Hargreaves had assistance. By any reckoning,
            <br>
            it is hard to see how the spinning jenny cost more than £500 to develop.
            <br>
            This was a significant sum, but it was less than many other textile inventions.</p>

        <h3>How does the Cotton Gin Work?</h3>
        <P>The cotton gin works by having a wooden drum that was covered in small hooks turn
            <br>
            behind a mesh. As the drum turns the hooks pull the cotton through the mesh which is large enough to allow<br>
            the cotton to move freely through it but small enough so that the seeds could not.</P>
